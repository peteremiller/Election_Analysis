##Overview of Election Audit
I was assisting a Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, with the ection audit of the tabulated results for a U. S. Congessional precinct. I was tasked with reporting the total votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of vote for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. Tom's manager, Seth,  wanted to know if there was a way to automate the process, normally done in Excel, by using Python. The code that Tom and I wrote may be used not only to audit other Congressional Districts but also Senatoral District elections and local elections. 

Tom and I took into account three voting methods: mail-in ballots, punch cards, and data from direct recording electronic machines. After the votes were tabulated from all three voting  methods, Tom and I generated a vote count report to certify this particular U. S. Congessional election.


##Election Audit Results
The results of this election audit are as follows:
  1. There were 369, 711 votes cast in this congressional election
  2. The percentage of votes and number of votes for each county in the precinct are:
